	<h2>My Passions😁</h2>
	<h2>🚦Formula 1🏎</h2>
	<p>I discovered my greatest passion at the age of 6 when I first watched a Formula 1 Grand Prix in which the greatest driver in the history of motor racing, Lewis Hamilton, won the German Grand Prix in 2011. It was at this precise moment that my passion was born and I decided that all my projects and objectives had one goal in common: Formula 1.</p>

	<h2>The Automobile🧰🧑‍🔧</h2>
	<p>The automobile is an increasingly important sector nowadays and fascinates me just as much as Formula 1 by the noise of the engines, the smell of gasoline or the speed ... . This field intrigues me a lot and makes me want to discover it every day.</p>
	<h2>🏉Rugby🏃</h2>
	<p>Rugby is a sport that makes me vibrate and that I live 100%. It is a sport that links team spirit and competition, which are two characteristics that I like to put forward, especially in my work.</p>
